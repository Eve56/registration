abstract = {This paper describes DARTEL, which is an algorithm for diffeomorphic image registration. It is implemented for both 2D and 3D image registration and has been formulated to include an option for estimating inverse consistent deformations. Nonlinear registration is considered as a local optimisation problem, which is solved using a Levenberg-Marquardt strategy. The necessary matrix solutions are obtained in reasonable time using a multigrid method. A constant Eulerian velocity framework is used, which allows a rapid scaling and squaring method to be used in the computations. DARTEL has been applied to intersubject registration of 471 whole brain images, and the resulting deformations were evaluated in terms of how well they encode the shape information necessary to separate male and female subjects and to predict the ages of the subjects.},

abstract = {In medical image analysis there is frequently a need to invert dense displacement fields which map one image space to another. In this paper we describe inversion techniques and determine their accuracy in the context of 18 inter-subject brain image registrations. Scattered data interpolation (SDI) is used to initialise locally and globally consistent iterative techniques. The inverse-consistency error, E(IC) is computed over the whole image and over 10 specific brain regions. SDI produced good results with mean (max) E(IC) approximately 0.02mm (2.0mm). Both iterative method produced mean errors of approximately 0.005mm but the globally consistent method resulted in a smaller maximum error (1.9mm compared with 1.4mm). The largest errors were in the cerebral cortex with large outlier errors in the ventricles. Simple iterative techniques are, on this evidence, able to produce reasonable estimates of inverse displacement fields provided there is good initialisation.},

abstract = {As image registration becomes more and more central to many biomedical imaging applications, the efficiency of the algorithms becomes a key issue. Image registration is classically performed by optimizing a similarity criterion over a given spatial transformation space. Even if this problem is considered as almost solved for linear registration, we show in this paper that some tools that have recently been developed in the field of vision-based robot control can outperform classical solutions. The adequacy of these tools for linear image registration leads us to revisit non-linear registration and allows us to provide interesting theoretical roots to the different variants of Thirion's demons algorithm. This analysis predicts a theoretical advantage to the symmetric forces variant of the demons algorithm. We show that, on controlled experiments, this advantage is confirmed, and yields a faster convergence.},

abstract = {Modern morphometric studies use non-linear image registration to compare anatomies and perform group analysis. Recently, log-Euclidean approaches have contributed to promote the use of such computational anatomy tools by permitting simple computations of statistics on a rather large class of invertible spatial transformations. In this work, we propose a non-linear registration algorithm perfectly fit for log-Euclidean statistics on diffeomorphisms. Our algorithm works completely in the log-domain, i.e. it uses a stationary velocity field. This implies that we guarantee the invertibility of the deformation and have access to the true inverse transformation. This also means that our output can be directly used for log-Euclidean statistics without relying on the heavy computation of the log of the spatial transformation. As it is often desirable, our algorithm is symmetric with respect to the order of the input images. Furthermore, we use an alternate optimization approach related to Thirion's demons algorithm to provide a fast non-linear registration algorithm. First results show that our algorithm outperforms both the demons algorithm and the recently proposed diffeomorphic demons algorithm in terms of accuracy of the transformation while remaining computationally efficient.},

@article{Heinrich2012,
abstract = {Deformable registration of images obtained from different modalities remains a challenging task in medical image analysis. This paper addresses this important problem and proposes a modality independent neighbourhood descriptor (MIND) for both linear and deformable multi-modal registration. Based on the similarity of small image patches within one image, it aims to extract the distinctive structure in a local neighbourhood, which is preserved across modalities. The descriptor is based on the concept of image self-similarity, which has been introduced for non-local means filtering for image denoising. It is able to distinguish between different types of features such as corners, edges and homogeneously textured regions. MIND is robust to the most considerable differences between modalities: non-functional intensity relations, image noise and non-uniform bias fields. The multi-dimensional descriptor can be efficiently computed in a dense fashion across the whole image and provides point-wise local similarity across modalities based on the absolute or squared difference between descriptors, making it applicable for a wide range of transformation models and optimisation algorithms. We use the sum of squared differences of the MIND representations of the images as a similarity metric within a symmetric non-parametric Gauss-Newton registration framework. In principle, MIND would be applicable to the registration of arbitrary modalities. In this work, we apply and validate it for the registration of clinical 3D thoracic CT scans between inhale and exhale as well as the alignment of 3D CT and MRI scans. Experimental results show the advantages of MIND over state-of-the-art techniques such as conditional mutual information and entropy images, with respect to clinically annotated landmark locations.},

@article{Heinrich2012a,
abstract = {Deformable image registration poses a highly non-convex optimisation problem. Conventionally, medical image registration techniques rely on continuous optimisation, which is prone to local minima. Recent advances in the mathematics and new programming methods enable these disadvantages to be overcome using discrete optimisation. In this paper, we present a new technique deeds, which employs a discrete dense displacement sampling for the deformable registration of high resolution CT volumes. The image grid is represented as a minimum spanning tree. Given these constraints a global optimum of the cost function can be found efficiently using dynamic programming, which enforces the smoothness of the deformations. Experimental results demonstrate the advantages of deeds: the registration error for the challenging registration of inhale and exhale pulmonary CT scans is significantly lower than for two state-of-the-art registration techniques, especially in the presence of large deformations and sliding motion at lung surfaces.},

@article{Li2012,
abstract = {This paper presents registration via embedded maps (REM), a deformable registration algorithm for images with varying topology. The algorithm represents 3-D images as 4-D manifolds in a Riemannian space (referred to as embedded maps). Registration is performed as a surface evolution matching one embedded map to another using a diffusion process. The approach differs from those existing in that it takes an a priori estimation of image regions where topological changes are present, for example lesions, and generates a dense vector field representing both the shape and intensity changes necessary to match the images. The algorithm outputs both a diffeomorphic deformation field and an intensity displacement which corrects the intensity difference caused by topological changes. Multiple sets of experiments are conducted on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with lesions from OASIS and ADNI datasets. These images are registered to either a brain template or images of healthy individuals. An exemplar case registering a template to an MRI with tumor is also given. The resulting deformation fields were compared with those obtained using diffeomorphic demons, where topological changes are not modeled. These sets of experiments demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed REM method for registration of brain MRI with severe topological differences.},
